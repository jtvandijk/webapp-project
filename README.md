# GB Names Website
[GB Names](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/gbnames/) focuses upon the origins and spread of family bloodlines through surnames as manifest in the past and over 
more recent years. Under development. This repository contains all code for the website to run -- not the code for generating the statistics and measures
that are presented on the website.

## About
Digitally encoded Historic Census data for England, Scotland, and Wales provide population-wide microdata of individuals’ names
and addresses. This integrated collection of historic census microdata covers the decennial census of England and Wales for 
1851, 1861, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911, and for Scotland for the period 1851 to 1901. The addresses are linked to parishes, 
which have been digitised into a set of two consistent parish geographies. See for more information: 
[Higgs and Schürer 2014](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=7481).

Because contemporary censuses do not disclose names, extensive databases of names at the addresses-level were sought from 
public versions of the electoral register from 1997 until 2016, with supplements from consumer data from 2002 onwards to 
capture those that opt-out or are not eligible to vote. The ‘Consumer Registers’ are linked to bolster their coverage and 
are found to be representative of the vast majority of the UK’s adult population. See for more information:

## Notes
Notes
GB Names is intended to show interesting geographical patterns of names, rather than mapping individuals or families. 
We do not map or show statistics for names with less than 30 occurences per year or for areas where the selected name has a 
very small population.
