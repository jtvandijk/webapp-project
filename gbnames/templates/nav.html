        <h4>Methodology</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body text-justify">
      <h5>Data</h5>
      <p>
        GBNames traces the origins and spread of family groups as manifest through surnames over the distant and more recent past.
        Digitally encoded historical census data for England, Scotland, and Wales provided by the Economic and Social Research Council
        <a href="https://www1.essex.ac.uk/history/research/icem/">I-CeM project</a> provide population-wide microdata of individuals’
        names and addresses (following a secure data user agreement by researchers). This integrated collection of historic census
        microdata derives from the decennial Censuses of England and Wales for 1851, 1861, 1881, 1891, 1901 and 1911,
        and for Scotland for the period 1851 to 1901 (although we do not use the 1871 data). Addresses are georeferenced to parishes,
        the boundaries of which have been digitised. See for more information: <a href="https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=7481">Higgs and Schürer (2014)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual names and addresses cannot be obtained from censuses until the data are 100 years old, and so we use consumer
        registers for the period 1997-2016: details of these data are available in <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12476">Lansley <em>et al.</em> (2019)</a>.
      </p>
      <h5>Funding</h5>
      <p>
        This work is funded by the UK ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) grant reference ES/L011840/1 and EPSRC grant EP/M023583/1 (‘UK Regions Digital Research Facility’).
      </p>
      <h5 id="m1">Maps</h5>
      <p>
        One way to analyse and compare individual surname distributions over time without needing to accommodate changing administrative
        areas is to assign individual occurrences of names to the central point (centroid) of the parishes that existed when each of the
        historical censuses was conducted. For the more recent past, we geocode all adult individuals found in the Consumer Registers
        using georeferenced postcodes. We then map the over-all geographic distribution of these points on a surname-by-surname basis
        using a technique called kernel density estimation (KDE), in effect placing a search window (kernel) over successive locations
        and recording changes in the density of points across space. Details of the technique are available in the 6th Edition of
        M. J. de Smith, M. F. Goodchild, and P.A. Longley (2018) Geospatial Analysis, available online at
        <a href="https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/HTML/index.html?density__kernels_and_occupancy.htm">www.spatialanalysisonline.com</a>,
        and in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2011.591291">Cheshire and Longley (2011)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the historical census data, KDEs are calculated only for surnames that have at least 30 individual bearers. For the more
        contemporary Consumer Registers, a minimum threshold of 50 adults is used. The reasons for this are in part technical, because
        KDE calculations cannot be executed for small numbers of points. When mapping consumer data, these thresholds are used also to
        avoid the possibility of disclosing the precise areas where living individual reside. The KDE calculations are parallelised
        through <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a> and executed using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>
        scripting language (with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.7577">Sparr</a> library). More information on these procedures
        is available in one of our academic papers: <a href="http://www.newcastle.gisruk.org/proceedings/">Van Dijk <em>et al.</em> (2019)</a>.

      </p>
      <h5 id="m2">Historical Forenames / Recent Forenames</h5>
      <p>
        For your selected surname, we provide the most popular associated forenames for all residents between 1851-1911 and those for
        adults between 1997-2016. Historical forenames are classified as male or female using census returns from the period, while a
        lookup table is used for the more recent period.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m3">Top Historical Parishes / Top Contemporary Areas</h5>
      <p>
        We identify the historical and present day areas in which your selected surname occurs most frequently. The Top Historical
        Parishes identify Registration Districts as well as Parishes, while the Top Contemporary Areas are divisions of present day (2011) Local Authority
        Districts (Middle layer Super Output Areas). These are calculated as the highest frequencies over the historical or recent periods.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m4">Output Area classification</h5>
      <p>
        This is a classification of neighbourhoods, arranged into Supergroups and Groups based upon 2011 Census of Population data.
        We created this through a collaboration with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and plan to update it following the
        2021 Census. We show the 2011 OAC Supergroup and Group in which your selected surname occurs most frequently. The classification
        is described fully in <a href="http://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/view/232">Gale <em>et al.</em> (2011)</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m5">Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards (AHAH)</h5>
      <p>
        AHAH is a multi-dimensional index for Great Britain developed by the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) in order to describe
        neighbourhoods as more or less healthy places in which to live. Various data describe access to retail facilities,
        health services, and physical features. Neighbourhoods can be ranked from best to worst and we show the decile in which your
        selected surname occurs most frequently. The classification is fully described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2018.08.019">Green <em>et al.</em> (2018)</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m6">Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)</h5>
      <p>
        Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMDs) are periodically calculated by UK governments in order to summarise prevailing physical
        and social conditions at neighbourhood scale. Assuming equivalence between different national measures, we use the 2019 IMDs for
        England and Wales and the 2016 Index for Scotland in order to identify the modal decile within which your selected surname falls.
        You can read more about the calculation of the IMDs for: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019">England</a>,
        <a href="https://gov.wales/welsh-index-multiple-deprivation">Wales</a>, and <a href="https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD">Scotland</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m7">Broadband Speed</h5>
      <p>
        This statistic records the modal value of the broadband speed available to bearers of your selected surname, based upon the fixed broadband download speed in Mbit/s.
        You can find out more information at <a href="https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/broadband-speed">Broadband Speed</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m8">Internet User Classification</h5>
      <p>
        The Consumer Data Research Centre Internet User Classification describes the nature and extent of Internet usage by the residents
        of neighbourhoods across Great Britain. We show the Group into which the largest number of bearers of your selected surname fall.
        You can read more about this classification in <a href="http://cdrc.ac.uk/book">Alexiou and Singleton (2018)</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m9">Consumer Vulnerability</h5>
      <p>
        This measure, created at the University of Leeds, summarises consumer vulnerability to marketing materials, based upon data
        such as age, health and household composition. Vulnerability varies according to product category and industry, as well as
        consumer characteristics such as mental, physical and financial circumstances. More details are are available at
        <a href="https://github.com/michael-adcock/consumer_vulnerability">Adcock (2018)</a>.
      </p>
      <h5 id="m10">Frequencies</h5>
      <p class="mb-0">
        For your selected name, we show the total number of (adult and child) occurrences for 1851-1911 (excluding 1871 because of
        non-availability of data for England and Wales and excluding unavailable data for Scotland for 1911). The corresponding
        figures for 1997-2011 are estimated adult frequencies.
